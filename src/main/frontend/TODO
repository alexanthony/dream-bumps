* Flow everything
* Tests in backend
* All those "// Throw an error" bits of validation in Java...
* User edit screen (self service)
* When setting crew value after buy/sell, actually sum the crew value, don't just work it out (rounding)
* Move to reselect - hopefully sort the performance issues out. and load all the crews/crew members in one hit
* lock down the endpoints for the scrapers
